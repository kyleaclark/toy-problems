* Solved in JavaScript

##### Fibonacci Calculation
* Given an integer find the associated number recursively in a fibonacci sequence, and use a cached value if the number has already been solved for.
* Solved in JavaScript

##### Knapsack - Greedy Knapsack
* Implement a greedy algorithm which returns a list of lists where each inner list represents a container of item names.
